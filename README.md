## FAQ

#### Where do I find my client_id and client_secret?

You will need to [register your application](https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/authentication/register-app/) on Twitch Developer.

#### StreamSniper does not find any streams!

Your configuration may conflict with other settings or your filter may be too strict.
